### OSX üíª 
I love using GNU compiler, and to install it you will need to:
 
 - Install [`Apple Command Line Tools`](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/)
 
 - Install a package manager
 ```bash
 $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
 ```
 
 - Check if [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) is updated
 ```bash
 $ brew update
 ```
 
 - Install the compiler
 ```bash
 $ brew install gcc
 ```
